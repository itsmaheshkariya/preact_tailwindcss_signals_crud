## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Preact + Tailwindcss + Signals project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── assets/
│       └── UserForm.jsx
│   └── components/
│       └── UserForm.jsx
│       └── UserTable.jsx
│   └── signals/
│       └── user.js
│   └── App.jsx
└── package.json
└── index.html
└── tailwind.config.cjs
└── vite.config.js
└── postcss.config.cjs
└── yarn.lock
```

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands
